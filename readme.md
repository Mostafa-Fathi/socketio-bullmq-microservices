📌 socketio-bullmq-microservices
A Node.js microservices demo using Socket.io for real-time communication and BullMQ (Redis-based queue) for inter-service messaging.

📖 Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
✅ Use Socket.io to manage real-time WebSocket connections at the API Gateway.
✅ Use BullMQ (powered by Redis) as a queue to communicate between microservices.
✅ Broadcast events from services to connected clients via WebSockets.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Node.js (Express.js)
Socket.io (WebSockets)
BullMQ (Queue system)
Redis (Used for BullMQ)
Docker (For Redis)
